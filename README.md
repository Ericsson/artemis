# artemis
Artemis is a highly scalable parallel and distributed cloud simulation suite that can be used to simulate cloud scenarios involving millions of live simulation entities and thousands of events per second. It provides the base APIs for creation and modelling of cloud resources, cloud consumers, and cloud control mechanisms. Artemis is developed with the main focus on design, implementation and evaluation of methodologies targeting the outstanding problems in cloud computing such as virtual service placement, dynamic resource management, resource provision modelling, resource usage modelling, virtual network embedding, cloud dimensioning, resource monitoring, fault tolerance, and high availability.
